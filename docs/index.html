    <h1>Welcome to ScopeBuddy GUI!</h1>
    <p>Gamescope is a micro-compositor made by ValveSoftware that is used to simplify running games and other software. It can handle a lot of things many games struggle with such as extreme resolutions, entering fullscreen, extremely wide monitors, and more! This can greatly reduce glitchy behavior, improving the gaming experience. </p>
    <p>Scopebuddy is a tool made by HikariKnight that makes it easier to use Gamescope. It allows you to do many things, which includes creating a general Gamescope configuration for all of your games. </p>
    <p>Scopebuddy-gui (this program) was not made by HikariKnight. It is lacks many of the features present in Scopebuddy itself, but provides an easy to use UI for the more basic features of scopebuddy.</p>
