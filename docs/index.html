            <h1>Welcome to ScopeBuddy GUI!</h1>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> is a micro-compositor made by ValveSoftware that is used to simplify running games and other software. It can handle a lot of things many games struggle with such as extreme resolutions, entering fullscreen, extremely wide monitors, and more! This can greatly reduce glitchy behavior, improving the gaming experience.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/HikariKnight/ScopeBuddy" target="_blank">Scopebuddy</a> is a tool made by HikariKnight that makes it easier to use Gamescope. It allows you to do many things, which includes creating a general Gamescope configuration for all of your games.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/rfrench3/scopebuddy-gui" target="_blank">Scopebuddy GUI</a> (this program) lacks many of the advanced features present in Scopebuddy itself, but provides an easy to use UI for many very useful features of scopebuddy.</p>

            <h1>Creating a config</h1>
            <p>A text field left blank is the same as a checkbox left unchecked – it will use Gamescope's default setting. Sometimes a field cannot be left blank, such as providing width without height, because Gamescope does not allow for it.
            <p>When the GUI applies a new config, it comments out the old config in ~/.config/scopebuddy/ while adding a new line with the new config. This means worse-case, you can manually reapply any old configuration! It can build up over time with excessive config editing, but text files are small and it is easy enough to manually clean out if ever necessary.</p>
            <p>Scopebuddy itself is extremely powerful, and this GUI does not currently aim to cover all of its power – it does aim to be safe to use alongside any such advanced configuration, however.</p>
