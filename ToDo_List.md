# To-Do List

## reduced features build:

To ensure I get out a useful version of the app in a useful packaging format (Flatpak), I have made this build. Any major planned features (such as game-specific configs) will not be present to any extent until I am fully confident they are ready. My main goal is to get out a presentable "version 1" to avoid being overtaken by scope creep.
