# To-Do List

## Features (add new stuff)

- implement game-specific configs

- make a pretty icon

- add more gamescope args

- add a button to reset the config to default (if scopebuddy doesn't have one, just make sensible defaults)

- add a button to open the config file in a text editor

- instructions to put scopebuddy launch args in steam, or do it automatically

## Bugfixes (make old stuff work)

- make the window look prettier

- text indicating an empty config file, instead of just showing nothing
