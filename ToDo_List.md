# To-Do List.md

- implement game-specific configs

- text indicating an empty config file, instead of just showing nothing

- make the window look prettier

- make a pretty icon

- indicate that the old configs are stored in the config file and not deleted

- add more gamescope args

- clicking the apply button should make a popup telling you what the changes are, allowing you to accept or cancel

- add a button to reset the config to default (if scopebuddy doesn't have one, just make sensible defaults)

- add a button to open the config file in a text editor

- instructions to put scopebuddy launch args in steam, or do it automatically
